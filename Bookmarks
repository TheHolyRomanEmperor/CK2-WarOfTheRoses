1. January 1, 1453: Fall of Constanstinople

- As the 100 Years' War betwen England and France comes to an end, the Turkish Ottoman Empire captures Constanstinople, causing the end of the Eastern Roman Empire.
- Interesting characters:

* Henry Lancaster (Henry VI of England)
Starts at war with France for the 100 Years' War on the losing side with a ton of negative warscore
Has Richard York (Richard, Duke of York) as regent. 
When Henry loses the war, he will get many negative traits including incapable (representing his post war breakdown). This causes regent Richard York to take conrol.

* Charles Valois (Charles VI of France)
Starts at war with England for the 100 Years' War on the winning side with a ton of positive war score.

* Caliph Mehmed Ottoman the Conqueror (Mehmed II)
Starts at war with the Byzantine Empire for Constanstinople. Owns tons of holdings in E. Europe and Anatolia.

* Constantine XI Palaeologus
Starts at war with Mehmed
Last Byzantine Emperor
Has Constanstinople (whcih has tons of negative province flags that decreases it's massive levy and tax) and a tributary in Athens
Basically fucked.
