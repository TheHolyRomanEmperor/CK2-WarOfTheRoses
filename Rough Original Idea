CKII is above all else a game of dynastic managment. The War of the Roses and the politics of that era seem much better modelled by CKII than EUIV.

A War of the Roses DLC would add some later bookmarks and an extension. And for the features side would focus on dynasty mechanics, especially rivalrys.

Outside of the War of the Roses itself it could allow for the inclusion of a few other interseting events-

*Emergence of the Spanish Inquisition

*The end of the 100 years war.

*The 13 years' war between Poland and the Teutonic Order.

*The Ottomon's pushing into Eastern Europe.

*Sonni Ali uniting the Songhai Empire.

*Vlad Ţepeş

*Unification of Spain

*Stephen the Great

*Burgundinian Wars

*Muscovy conquering Novogrod

I could go on with my other ideas but that is a rough out line of what I thought and I'm interested to hear other's thoughts.

I feel like, in Britain at least, the end of the Wars of the Roses is as close as you can get to a good cut-off between 'dark age' Britain and the more modern statist way the country came to be ran in Tudor times and onwards. The war itself, it's 'cast' and the reasons behind it seem like the exact type of story that ckii is perfect to create.

I feel like EUIV robbed us of some of the events that define and end the "ckii era" haha.
